   <h2>Summary</h2>
   I'm a small human being, a foodie, I love playing and running after things, especially balls and things that have a whistle. I love my teddy bear TedBear, I'm a nature lover, but what I like most is eating.
<hr />
    <h2>Education</h2>
    I was educated in the school of German etiquette "If it runs, the animal will catch it, if it stays, the animal will eat it". My father educated me and taught me many things, while my mother tried to enroll me in Zack's University, but without success as my IQ is above average.
